# 🔍 Flag Discovery Writeup

## 🗂️ Steps I Took
1. Downloaded and extracted the given file.  
2. Navigated to:
3. Opened the `thumbnail_cache` file with the **earliest creation time** → nothing useful.  
4. Then opened the one created at **5:11** → and *bingo*!  
5. The **last `.bmp` thumbnail** contained the flag. 🎉

## ⏱️ Difficulty
This might look simple when written out, but it actually took me **hours of searching, experimenting, and frustration** before finding the right cache.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Thumb Cache Viewer** (a Windows tool to inspect cached thumbnails).  
- You can download it online.  
- I’ll attach it as well in case you want to try — hopefully it runs on your PC. 🙂
